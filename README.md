# OsmAnd2web

render GPX waypoints from OsmAnd on a website.

## Situation

I'm using [OsmAnd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.plus) as my favourite map app on the mobile. While travelling I often put markers on the map from places I've visited. This repo is a solution, to bring these markers from OsmAnd to a website.

## Configuration

In the file `import.php` it is necessary to type in the names of the waypoint categories you wish to be shown on the map.

You need an own access token from mapbox.com. Put it in the `tileLayer` section of `index.html`.

## Upload GPX
